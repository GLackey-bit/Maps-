# The Simplest Maps of Countries (Easy R-Script)

This is a really simple and effective R-script to map countries to include important information such as borders, and co-ordinates. 

I use this script to make skeletons of countries and then I annotate them using BioRender, which (for me) is a really easy and quick way to produce a informative map.

Hope this helps you, and happy coding !
